If you're using the Nvidia app from PC, make sure the output is set to iFacialMocap, you can use any input you'd like
In this case, leave the IP at 127.0.0.1, you shouldn't have to change any settings

Note: The module was developed with the Nvidia PC app, we do not have access to iPhones, so even though they're fully supported, we might not be able to easily solve problems when using iPhone, make sure Windows firewalls are set correctly, put your Network profile on Private and double check the settings on your iphone app
